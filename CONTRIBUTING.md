Contributing to Oils of Joy

Hey everyone, this site was built to help my mother in law out for products she creates using essential oils. If you see any ways you would like to contribute, feel free.

Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with any of the code and you believe it needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of the content and/or screenshots if applicable. I will try to regularly review issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as best I can.

Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

Fork this repository
Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
Open a Pull Request against this repo
I will review your change and approve or comment on it in due course.

Why Contribute?

To just make everything we do better... all opinions welcome, I am still and alwyas will be learning.
